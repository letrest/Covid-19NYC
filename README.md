It's an application that allows one to easily search for Covid19 data on different neighborhoods in NYC

It's using uploaded NYC.gov data from here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/tests-by-zcta.csv 
that data is then combined with data on the "zip code & neighborhood names" and a "zip lat long" lists from different sources
the data was last updated on 4/11/20 

It uses algoliaâ€™s search technology and google maps to quickly and easily lookup and compare the impact that the virus is having on neighborhoods across the five boroughs.

Future steps could be 
    * To automate the addition of data by crawling and the creation of the indices from it
    * To get a more granular list of neighborhoods
    * Update the marker sizes on zoom in/out
    * Superimpose a layer of zip boundaries onto the map
    * Update the UI
    * Use google's geolocation for the zip lat longs
